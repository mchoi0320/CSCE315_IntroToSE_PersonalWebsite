              I am a senior at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/"" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a> pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus in Statistics, and here is a little story.
              <br><br>
              Back when I was still a senior in high school, my dream major was Biomedical Engineering, so how did I end up in Computer Science instead? Ironically, the first spark for my 
              interest in the field lit up during my <i>freshman</i> year of high school. I took a mandatory introductory computer science class, where I learned to use Scratch, Python, HTML, and Alice. 
              After the year ended, however, I shifted my focus back to biomedical engineering in order to somewhat achieve my childhood dream of medically helping people.
              <br><br>
              Then came freshman year of college at Texas A&M. Once again, I had to take a mandatory introductory programming course. Once again, my interest in computer science sparked. But this 
              time, it grew into a fire and there was no stopping it<span>&#8212;</span>I had way too much fun in the course! So here I am, still loving computer science as much as I did when I was 
              still printing, “Hello, World!” despite the headaches it comes with nowadays.
              <br><br>
              I never hesitate to say that I am passionate about computer science. I may not be the best, but I certainly am beyond willing and am quick to learn new things such as languages, 
              frameworks, etc. I am a flexible and positive individual who knows the importance of communication in teamwork.
              <br><br>
              In my leisure time, I like to play video games and watch the most random videos online ranging from gaming clips to cooking tutorials to videos of adorable animals. I absolutely 
              love animals, hence the picture of me with <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/traditions/aggie-culture/reveille/index.html" target="_blank">Reveille</a>! Recently, I have become interested in learning 
              to play sports like basketball, volleyball, and tennis properly instead of just playing for fun. I also really love to sing until I get tired!

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
              I am proficient in C++ and Python and have moderate experience using C, Java, Haskell, and Git.
              I am also familiar with front-end web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks
              like Bootstrap and Flask API.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Technical Interests</h2>
            <p>
              Currently, my primary interest lies in UI/UX and web development because I enjoy thinking about ways to assemble visual elements to engage an audience with diverse, 
              interactive features that will leave a lasting impression without being distracting. This interest is probably a result of my fascination for psychology. However, 
              I am also interested in game design, software development, and data science, as it just seems so exciting to work on large projects in these disciplines. Additionally, 
              I would like to learn more about cybersecurity and human-computer interation.

                <a href="https://devpost.com/software/deplane-mwdart" target="_blank">DePlane</a> is a web application product developed as a team during 
                <a href="https://tamuhack.com/" target="_blank">TAMUhack</a> 2020. It allows the user to both obtain information about their landing destination and control 
                features found during flight. We are proud to have created our own back-end service comprising of multiple APIs, as it made accessing our data much easier 
                and faster. Also, we were able to implement the caching of different results from the APIs to limit the requests made to the services. Through this project, 
                we learned how to implement Google's APIs and how to access APIs resourcefully to not go over any limits presented with the services.

                elevators can move between floors, and/or pick-up/drop-off passengers.

              On Saturday, March 30, 2019, 82 Aggies, former students, and Aggie family members came together to participate in The Big Event: McAllen. <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">The Big Event</a> is 
              the nation’s largest one-day service project where students show appreciation for their community’s continued support of Texas A&M University students during their college careers. The BIG Event: McAllen 
              provided support to the Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley where volunteers helped facilitate food access and safety for the 64,000+ individuals that the Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley served 
              during the first week of April in 2019. This impact includes the 1,200 food packages assembled by Aggies that were distributed to senior citizens in the community.

              After my experience at The Big Event, I returned to the <a href="https://foodbankrgv.com/" target="_blank">Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley</a> to volunteer because I genuinely felt the importance of helping at the facility 
              to assist in packaging and distributing nutritious food quickly yet safely to those who need it. I also helped to clean and maintain a sanitary work area.
