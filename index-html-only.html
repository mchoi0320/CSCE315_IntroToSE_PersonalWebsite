          <p>
            I am a senior at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/"" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a> pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a focus in Statistics, and here is a little story.
            <br><br>
            Back when I was still a senior in high school, my dream major was Biomedical Engineering, so how did I end up in Computer Science instead? Ironically, the first spark for my 
            interest in the field lit up during my <i>freshman</i> year of high school. I took a mandatory introductory computer science class, where I learned to use Scratch, Python, HTML, and Alice. 
            After the year ended, however, I shifted my focus back to biomedical engineering in order to somewhat achieve my childhood dream of medically helping people.
            <br><br>
            Then came freshman year of college at Texas A&M. Once again, I had to take a mandatory introductory programming course. Once again, my interest in computer science sparked. But this 
            time, it grew into a fire and there was no stopping it<span>&#8212;</span>I had way too much fun in the course! So here I am, still loving computer science as much as I did when I was 
            still printing, “Hello, World!” despite the headaches it comes with nowadays.
            <br><br>
            I never hesitate to say that I am passionate about computer science. I may not be the best, but I certainly am beyond willing and am quick to learn new things such as languages, 
            frameworks, etc. I am a flexible and positive individual who knows the importance of communication in teamwork.
            <br><br>
            In my leisure time, I like to play video games and watch the most random videos online ranging from gaming clips to cooking tutorials to videos of adorable animals. I absolutely 
            love animals, hence the picture of me with <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/traditions/aggie-culture/reveille/index.html" target="_blank">Reveille</a>! Recently, I have become interested in learning 
            to play sports like basketball, volleyball, and tennis properly instead of just playing for fun. I also really love to sing until I get tired!

          <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p>
            I am proficient in C++ and Python and have moderate experience using C, Java, Haskell, and Git.
            I am also familiar with front-end web development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks
            like Bootstrap and Flask API.
          </p>
          <h3>Technical Interests</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, my primary interest lies in UI/UX and web development because I enjoy thinking about ways to assemble visual elements to engage an audience with diverse, 
            interactive features that will leave a lasting impression without being distracting. This interest is probably a result of my fascination for psychology. However, 
            I am also interested in game design, software development, and data science, as it just seems so exciting to work on large projects in these disciplines. Additionally, 
            I would like to learn more about cybersecurity and human-computer interation.
